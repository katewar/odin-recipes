# Odin Recipes Website - The Cilantro Bible
This is a simple recipes website project based off The Odin Project curriculum.

The goal of this project is to utilize and showcase my skills in HTML.

## Future To-Do List
* Refine and add more recipes
* The site's intended audience is cilantro-lovers and providing recipes that incorporate cilantro. It may be beneficial to provide additional resources on how to grow cilantro at home to use in the recipes.
* Improve website with CSS and JavaScript as I become more familiar with these languages throughout The Odin Project curriculum.
